# Simple Neural Nets

## Description

This repository demonstrates the training of neural nets on two datasets. The datasets come from the textbook
*Machine Learning Refined: Foundations, Algorithms, and Applications* by Watt, Borhani, and Katsaggelos. The two
exercises solved are 13.1 and 13.2. See (https://github.com/jermwatt/machine_learning_refined) for many resources
related to the textbook including notes, libraries, and data. The code adapts some of the code in the multilayer
perceptron library from the text.
